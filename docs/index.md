## WMAP
*The Web-based Message Authentication Protocol*

WMAP lets you validate messages against your friends' SSH pubkeys.
GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket all post SSH public keys in known
locations: simply sign your messages as `https://github.com/<USERNAME>`
and your friends will be able to verify their integrity.
